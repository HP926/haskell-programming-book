-- In the Eq instance for Date, we didnâ€™t recapitulate how equality for DayOfWeek and Int values worked; 
-- we simply said that the dates were equal if all of their constituent values were equal. 
-- Note, also, that the compiler already expects the arguments of Date to be a DayOfWeek value and an Int so we do not need to specify that. 
-- Based on what it knows about those three types, this is enough information for us to test Date values for equality.
